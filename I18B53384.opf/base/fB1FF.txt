Illustrious One, you have compassion for this world that garners painAnd evil when unwisely thinking entities are real or
not;They’re born and pass away, they lose the pleasant, find unpleasant things –Through love for them you spurn your pe
ace, ignore your own transcendent state. (11.51)

The bhikshu Chandrakirti’s wayIs based upon the Treatise onThe Middle Way, conforming toThe scriptures and direct advice.
(11.52)

Just as no other source presentsThis dharma in this accurate way,The wise should recognise that whatIs found herein is qu
ite unique. (11.53)

Some, frightened by the oceanic tinge of Nagarjuna’s mind,Have kept their distance to this wonderful tradition; but right
nowThe dew that makes his verses open like a waterlily’s budsHave settled, and the hopes of Chandrakirti, Famous Moon, 
are met. (11.54)

The scary depths of this reality presented here, is only graspedBy those with some experience – though learned, others wi
ll not comprehend.Thus seeing them as self-devised traditions – those who claim there is a self,Or any other groups – pl
ace not your trust in any other school but this. (11.55)

May all the merit gathered from explaining Nāgārjuna’s way fill all of space,Their intellects, a sky obscured by the affl
ictions, be lit up by autumn stars,And as they catch the jewel from the cobra’s head, their minds, may the entire worldT
hus come to understand reality and swiftly travel to sugatahood. (11.56)

This completes Entering the Middle Way, elucidating the profound and the vast, composed by the master Candrakīrti, an uph
older of the supreme vehicle who possessed invincible wisdom and compassion, and who by milking the painted cow defeated
clinging to true existence.This was translated from a Kashmiri manuscript by the Indian preceptor Tilaka Kalaśa and the
translator Patsab Nyimadrak in the Ratnagupta temple in the Kashmiri city Anupama (Shrinagar) during the reign of the K
ashmiri king Śrī Āryadeva. It was subsequently edited and finalised based on a manuscript from the eastern country of Ap
arānta by the Indian preceptor Kanakavarman and the same Tibetan translator in the Ramoche temple in Lhasa (Rasa).The au
thor’s and the translators’ colophons have here been brought into harmony with those of the commentary, and the differen
ces there might have been between the root text and the commentary have been amended.
