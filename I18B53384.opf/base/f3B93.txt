‘Does your critique make contact with the criticised, or does it not?This may be asked, and aren’t you then accountable t
o this same fault?’‘As what you say will only serve to quash the view you hold yourself,Your criticism lacks the power t
o discredit what you aim.’ (6.171)

‘Because your cavilling is subject to the self-same consequenceAnd your denial of existent things is quite unreasonable,I
nsightful persons will not be convinced by what you have to say.You argue just to quarrel and have no position of your o
wn.’ (6.172)

To claim that it’s an issue whether this critique makes contact withThe criticised or not while criticising will only app
lyTo those thinking in absolutes, but we do not endorse a stance,And therefore this unwanted consequence does not apply 
to us. (6.173)

As when the features of the sun being eclipsedAre also seen in its reflected silhouette,That sun and likeness meet or not
is ludicrous,It happens in dependence, just conventionally. (6.174)

Although unreal, it helps us beautify our face.Just so, these arguments that have the power toRefine the face of wisdom c
an’t be verified.And still, know that the proof they give is realised. (6.175)

Yes, if the reason used as proof were something real,And real also the thing that we attempt to prove,The argument of con
tact would be relevant.Since it’s not so you’re only troubling yourself. (6.176)

That all things lack reality we show with ease.But it’s no easy matter for our challengerTo demonstrate how things exist 
inherently.Why tax the world with webs of shoddy pedantry? (6.177)

If having grasped the prior points, now please forgetThis extra censure, that of touch, expressly made.It wasn’t just for
frivolous wrangling this was said,But so that such additional points are recognised. (6.178)

That beings may be freed, this selflessness was taughtIn two ways, of phenomena and personal.And to his followers our Tea
cher taught the sameBy classifying it in various different ways. (6.179)

When emptiness is taught elaboratelyIt is of sixteen types, and when condensedIt is of four types – this is the approachA
dopted in the Greater Vehicle. (6.180)
