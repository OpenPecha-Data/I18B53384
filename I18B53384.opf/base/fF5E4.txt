The Tenth Ground: Cloud of Dharma

Upon them on the tenth ground every buddha now bestows supremeEmpowerment, and through their wisdom they now reach suprem
acy.Then from these victor’s heirs spontaneous rains of Dharma shower down,Like torrents from the clouds, so beings’ cro
ps of virtue may increase. (10.1)

Thus is the tenth resolve from Entering the Middle Way.
